# LWMP-YOLO Error Fix Summary

## Error: `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'list' and 'int'`

### Root Cause
The test script was incorrectly passing `ch` as a list `[3]` instead of an integer `3` to `parse_model`.

```python
# INCORRECT
ch = [3]  # This creates a list
model, save = parse_model(deepcopy(test_yaml), ch=ch, verbose=True)

# CORRECT
ch = 3  # This should be an integer
model, save = parse_model(deepcopy(test_yaml), ch=ch, verbose=True)
```

### Why This Matters
- `parse_model` expects `ch` to be an integer representing the number of input channels
- When `ch` is a list, `ch[f]` returns the entire list instead of an integer
- This list gets passed to `nn.Conv2d(in_channels, ...)` which expects an integer
- PyTorch's Conv2d tries to do `in_channels % groups` which fails with a list

### Fix Applied
Changed line 92 in `test_modules_debug.py`:
- From: `ch = [3]  # Input channels`
- To: `ch = 3  # Input channels (integer, not list!)`

### Key Takeaway
When using YOLO's `parse_model` function:
- `ch` parameter must be an integer (number of input channels)
- The function internally manages channel tracking as a list `[ch]`
- Don't confuse the input parameter type with the internal representation

This was a simple test script error, not an issue with the LWMP-YOLO implementation itself.
