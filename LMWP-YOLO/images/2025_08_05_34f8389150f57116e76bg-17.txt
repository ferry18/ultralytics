This is a block diagram of the C3TR Module.

The diagram includes a legend where * denotes a Concatenation operation and + denotes an Addition operation.

The data flow of the module is as follows:

An Input tensor is processed by two parallel CBS (Convolution, Batch Normalization, SiLU activation) blocks.

The output of the top CBS block is fed into an N x Bottleneck block.

The output of the N x Bottleneck block is concatenated (*) with the output of the bottom CBS block.

The result of the concatenation is passed through a third CBS block.

The output from this third CBS block splits and serves as input to two parallel paths: a lower path and an upper path.

Lower Path (Shortcut Connection):

The output of the third CBS block is passed directly as an input to the final Transformer Block.

Upper Path (Transformer Processing):
This path is enclosed within a large gray dashed rectangle.

The output of the third CBS block is first reshaped.

The reshaped tensor follows two sub-paths:

Sub-path A: It is fed into a sequence of 'n' Transformer Layer blocks. The input to the first Transformer Layer is the reshaped tensor.

Sub-path B: The same reshaped tensor is passed through a single Linear layer.

The final output of the 'n' Transformer Layer sequence (from Sub-path A) is added (+) to the output of the Linear layer (from Sub-path B).

The result of this addition is the second input to the final Transformer Block.

Transformer Layer Internal Structure:
The structure of a single Transformer Layer is detailed within an orange dashed rectangle, representing a self-attention mechanism.

An input tensor from a "Previeous layer" (presumed to be the output of the preceding layer) is provided.

This input is processed by three parallel Linear layers to generate the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) tensors.

Q, K, and V are fed into a Multihead Attention block.

The output of the Multihead Attention block is added (+) to the initial input from the "Previeous layer". This forms a residual connection.

The result of this addition is passed through a sequence of two Linear layers.

The output of the second Linear layer is added (+) to the input of the first Linear layer, forming a second residual connection.

The result of this second addition is the final output of the Transformer Layer.

Final Output:

The Transformer Block takes the two inputs from the lower and upper paths and produces the final Output of the C3TR module.
