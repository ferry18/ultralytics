The legend defines the following symbols:

Conv2d: A 2D Convolutional layer.

Concat: A concatenation operation.

Add: An element-wise addition operation.

Lightweight Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Module
This module processes four parallel input feature maps of different scales.

Input: Four feature maps, depicted as tensors of decreasing spatial dimensions from bottom to top.

Concatenation: The four input feature maps are merged along the channel dimension using a 'Concat' operation.

Convolution: The concatenated feature map is processed by a 'Conv2d' layer with a 1×1 kernel.

Activation: The result passes through a Rectified Linear Unit ('ReLU') activation function.

SE Block: The output of the ReLU function is fed into a Squeeze-and-Excitation ('SE') module.

The output of this module is the input for the Mini Residual Block.

Mini Residual Block
This block features a residual (or skip) connection.

Input: Receives the feature map from the Lightweight Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Module.

Residual Connection: A skip connection is established from the input of the block, which is later added to the output of the block's main processing path.

Main Path: The input is processed by the following sequence of layers:

A 'Conv2d' layer with a 3×3 kernel.

A 'BatchNorm2d' (2D Batch Normalization) layer.

A 'ReLU' activation function.

A second 'Conv2d' layer with a 3×3 kernel.

A second 'BatchNorm2d' layer.

Addition: The output of the main path (from the second 'BatchNorm2d' layer) is element-wise added to the input from the residual connection via the 'Add' operation.

Final Activation: The resulting sum is passed through a final 'ReLU' activation function.

The output of the final ReLU function is the overall output of the entire architecture shown.
