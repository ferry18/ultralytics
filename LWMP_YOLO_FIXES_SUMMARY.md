# LWMP-YOLO Recent Fixes Summary

## 1. AWDetectionLoss Initialization Fix

### Problem
`AttributeError: 'DetectionModel' object has no attribute 'args'`

### Solution
Added check in AWDetectionLoss.__init__ to create default args if missing:

```python
if not hasattr(model, 'args'):
    from types import SimpleNamespace
    model.args = SimpleNamespace(
        box=7.5,
        cls=0.5,
        dfl=1.5,
    )
```

## 2. YAML Configuration Simplification

### Problem
- Parameter count too high (2.3M vs expected lightweight)
- Complex concatenations with backbone features that aren't available
- Channel mismatches

### Solution
Created a simplified but effective YAML structure:
- PP-LCNet backbone (384 channels output)
- Lightweight channel progression: 384 → 192 → 96 → 48
- MAFR and C3TR applied at 192 channels
- Detection on P2 and P3 scales for small objects
- Total parameters should be significantly reduced

### Key Differences from Author's YAML
- Author's YAML assumes multi-scale output from backbone
- Our lcnet_075 only returns P5 feature
- Simplified structure avoids complex cross-layer connections
- Maintains the core LWMP-YOLO concepts (LCNet, MAFR, C3TR, P2 detection)

## 3. Model Scale Warning Fix

The warning "no model scale passed" is resolved by having the `scales` dictionary in the YAML.

## Next Steps

1. Test the model with the new configuration
2. Verify parameter count is reasonable for a lightweight model
3. Consider implementing multi-scale output from LCNetBackbone if needed for exact replication
